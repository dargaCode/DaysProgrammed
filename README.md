# Nth Day Programming
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

Udemy’s class videos were down earlier, so I took the opportunity to work on a little starter project I’ve had in mind for awhile now.

The main h1 has its text modified by code, and all the paragraphs with the history are created and added dynamically.

This is the first time I’ve generated new elements, even in class, so it was fun to track down that info and get it all working.
